# Learning trpc patterns

Just another learning repo. Not much to see I'm afraid.

Using the same tooling as used in the
["minimal example"](https://github.com/trpc/trpc/tree/main/examples/minimal)
of trpc example.

## Up and running

### Installation of dependencies

```
pnpm install
```

### Run the code

```

This will run the client and the server.
